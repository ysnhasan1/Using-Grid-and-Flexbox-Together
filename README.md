# Using-Grid-and-Flexbox-Together

### Using Grid and Flexbox together in complex structures can make your work easier.

In this project, I created a 2D structure on the website using Grid. 
You should remember that Flexbox is a really great option for one-dimensional structures. 
Well, since we know Grid, won't we use Flexbox? Of course we will use it. 
The easiest way to add somethings to our grid items is to use Flexbox. 
In this example, I created a Chessboard with Grid and centered chess items very easily with Flexbox. Also note that our website is responsive.

##### As you can see the application is very simple. We are using the grid items as selector in the CSS file. Then in this code block  we are setting that "display: flex;". We can now position everything on the grid items or give them the size that we want.
